# learn lodash
A TDD way of learning JS utility functions by reimplementing [Lodash](https://lodash.com/)

**Its strongly recommended** to enable [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/docs/language-javascript/) on all your PRs.

## Installation
```
npm ci
```

## Testing
```
npm test
```

## Exercise
1. Pick any method from the [Lodash documentation](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15).
2. Enable the corresponding test by renaming from `.xjs` -> `.js`
3. Create any missing files in root that test requires and add `exports`
4. Continue implementing the exported functions until test pass
5. File PR, Make sure it's tested, and get it reviewed
